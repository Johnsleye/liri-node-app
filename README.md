# liri-node-app
The LIRI node app will allow you to search for movies, songs, and tweets.
For Tweets
enter node liri my-tweets to display the latest tweets from Johnsleye1. Which is my twitter account I just created for the purpose of this app

For Songs
enter node liri spotify-this-song followed by the song of your choice to gather song information from the spotify API.

For Movies
enter node liri movie-this followed by the movie of your choice to get movie information from the OMDB API.

Or... For fun...
enter node do-what-it-says to allow liri to get information from the random.txt file and execute the relevant code. ALSO note that all of the data is printed to the log.txt file.

This was made using
npm: packages used were dotenv, request, twitter, and node-spotify-api. APIs: twitter, spotify, and OMDB.
